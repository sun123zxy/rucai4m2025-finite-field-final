- $G$ is a group, $G$ is cyclic, $G$ is infinite, then $G \cong (\mathbb Z, +)$.

- $F$ is a field, $g \in F$, $g$ has a minimal polynomial $p(x) \in F[X]$. then $F[g] \cong F[X]/(p)$.

  - In particular, it is finite. 

- $F$ is a field, $F^\times \cong (\mathbb Z, +)$, then $\mathrm{char} F = 2$.

- $F$ is an field of characteristic $2$. $F^\times$ is cyclic, say it is generated by $g$. 

  - Then $F = \mathbb F_2[g]$.

  - Then $g$ is algebraic over $\mathbb F_2$.

- Problem: $F$ is a field, $F^\times$ is cyclic. Then $F$ is finite.
