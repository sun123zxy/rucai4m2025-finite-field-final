- H01: $G$ is a group, $G$ is cyclic, $G$ is infinite, then $G \cong (\mathbb Z, +)$.

- H02: $E / F$ is a field extension, $g \in E$, if $g$ is integral over $F$, then $F[g]$ is finite dimensional over $F$.

- H03: $F$ is a field, $F^\times \cong (\mathbb Z, +)$, then $\mathrm{char} F = 2$.

- H04: $F$ is a field of characteristic $2$. $F^\times$ is cyclic.

  - Say $F^\times$ is generated by $g$. 

    - Then $g$ is integral over $\mathbb F_2$.

    - Then $F = \mathbb F_2[g]$.

  - Conclude that $F$ is finite, by H02.

- Problem: $F$ is a field, $F^\times$ is cyclic. Then $F$ is finite.

  - By contradiction, assume $F$ is infinite.
  - Then $F^\times$ is infinite.
  - Then $F^\times \cong (\mathbb Z, +)$ by H01.
  - Then $F$ is of characteristic $2$ by H03.
  - Then $F^\times$ is finite by H04.
  - Contradiction!
