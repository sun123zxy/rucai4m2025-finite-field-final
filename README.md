## Supporting Lemmas

- **`finite_of_finite_units`**: If the group of units $F^\times$ of a field $F$ is finite, then $F$ is finite. 
  - Proof: $F = F^\times \cup \{0\}$

- **`orderOf_eq_zero_of_cyclic_of_infinite`**: If $G$ is an infinite cyclic group, then every non-identity element has order 0.
  - This is because $G \cong (\mathbb{Z}, +)$, and in $\mathbb{Z}$ every non-zero element is of order zero.

- **`simple_extension_of_cyclic_generator`**: If $E/F$ is a field extension and the unit group $E^\times$ is generated by a single element $g$, then $E = F[g]$.

## Main Logic

- **`Field.finite_of_char_two_of_cyclic_units`**: If $F$ is a field of characteristic $2$ with cyclic unit group $F^\times$, then $F$ is finite.
  - Say $F^\times$ is generated by $g$
  - Then $g$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{F}_2$ (since $1 + g$ must be a power of $g$)
  - Then $F = \mathbb{F}_2[g]$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{F}_2$
  - Therefore $F$ is finite

- **`Field.finite_of_cyclic_units`**: If $F$ is a field with cyclic unit group $F^\times$, then $F$ is finite.

  - Assume $F$ is infinite
  - Then $F^\times$ is infinite (since $F = F^\times \cup \{0\}$)
  - Then all non-identity elements of $F^\times$ have order 0 (by `orderOf_eq_zero_of_cyclic_of_infinite`)
  - But $-1 \in F^\times$ has order $2$ unless $\mathrm{char} F = 2$
  - Therefore $\mathrm{char} F = 2$
  - Then $F$ is finite by `Field.finite_of_char_two_of_cyclic_units`
  - Contradiction!
